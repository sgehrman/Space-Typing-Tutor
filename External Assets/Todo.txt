Not a typing tutor, but a typing speed game. Compete with friends and have leaderboards.  Make a simple VR social game where two people can see avatars like Couch knights?

Type an rss feed
Type a Twitter feed
Type a reddit feed
type javascript/c++/c# code

On first launch, direct user to click tutorial first.
