This is a collection of User Interface experiments using Unreal Engine.

On the main menu, move your head to control the onscreen cursor.

Move over a sphere to select a level, then move cursor over center glowing dot to load the level.

To get back to the main menu, press the Gamepad Start button or the Enter key on the keyboard.

Each level is an experiment and not polished. Some are boring and pointless.
