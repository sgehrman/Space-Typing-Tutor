        "The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.",

        "The report of my death was an exaggeration.",

        "Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.",

        "Let us be thankful for the fools. But for them the rest of us could not succeed.",

        "It is easier to stay out than get out.",

        "It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.",

        "All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence; then success is sure.",

        "Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.",

        "Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.",

        "Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please.",

        "I have been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened.",

        "I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.",

        "I have spent most of my life worrying about things that have never happened.",

        "If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.",

        "The man who doesn't read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them.",

        "When I was younger, I could remember anything, whether it had happened or not.",

        "Whenever you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.",

        "The radical of one century is the conservative of the next. The radical invents the views. When he has worn them out the conservative adopts them."
