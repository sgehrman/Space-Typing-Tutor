        "He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else.",

        "He that is of the opinion money will do everything may well be suspected of doing everything for money.",

        "He that lives upon hope will die fasting.",

        "He that would live in peace and at ease, must not speak all he knows nor judge all he sees.",

        "If you know how to spend less than you get, you have the philosopher's stone.",

        "If you would persuade, you must appeal to interest rather than intellect.",

        "Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today.",

        "Old boys have their playthings as well as young ones; the difference is only in the price.",

        "So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.",

        "Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.",

        "But in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.",

        "Fish and visitors smell in three days.",

        "To lengthen thy life, lessen thy meals.",

        "Wish not so much to live long as to live well."
